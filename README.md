> [Galatians 2:19-21 BSB](https://bolls.life/BSB/48/2/)
> 
>  **19** For through the law I died to the law so that I might live to God. **20** I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me. **21** I do not set aside the grace of God. For if righteousness comes through the law, Christ died for nothing.

> [John 15:12-14 BSB](https://bolls.life/BSB/43/15/)
> 
>  **12** This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. **13** Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. **14** You are My friends if you do what I command you.

> [1 Corinthians 13:11-13 BSB](https://bolls.life/BSB/46/13/)
> 
>  **11** When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I set aside childish ways. **12** Now we see but a dim reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. **13** And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of these is love.
